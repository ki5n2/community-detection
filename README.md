# community-detection
This repository is for community detection. I'm studying unsupervised learning and I'm interested in applying unsupervised learning methodologies like clustering to graph data. I also like to apply data mining to graph data to identify hidden rules or characteristics in the data. So this repository will be a place to identify interesting rules or relationships in large network data.
